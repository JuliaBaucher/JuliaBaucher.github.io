## Summary

Led a strategic partnership framework between operational projects, support teams, and technology partners. Established governance structures, investment strategies, and continuous feedback mechanisms to align stakeholders, optimize resource allocation, and ensure successful project delivery across multiple initiatives.

## Problem

Operational projects lacked clear governance structures and alignment mechanisms with technology partners and support teams. This resulted in misaligned priorities, inefficient resource allocation, unclear accountability, and delayed project delivery.
