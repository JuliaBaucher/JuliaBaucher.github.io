## Summary

Led the European adaptation and deployment of a web application that automates task and role assignment for warehouse associates based on schedules, staffing needs, and training certifications. The rollout delivered 4.8 minutes saved per associate per day, incident reduction of 5-17%, and $4.1 million in total benefits, while ensuring GDPR compliance and improving efficiency and safety at scale.

## Problem

Warehouse operations faced inefficient manual task assignment processes that didn't account for associate skills, certifications, or optimal workload distribution. This led to safety incidents, productivity losses, and compliance risks, particularly when scaling across European sites with strict GDPR requirements.

## Context

The project involved adapting a workforce task allocation platform for European deployment across multiple warehouse sites. The solution needed to handle complex scheduling, training certifications, GDPR compliance, and local labor regulations while maintaining high performance and reliability.

## My Role

I acted as Product Owner for the European rollout:

- Led the European adaptation and deployment strategy
- Ensured GDPR compliance and data privacy requirements
- Defined requirements for training certification integration
- Aligned operations, engineering, and compliance teams across multiple countries
- Managed stakeholder expectations and change management
- Tracked rollout metrics and business impact

## Decisions & Trade-offs


- **EU regionalization over global product**: Chose a separate EU deployment to meet GDPR and worker-council constraints, accepting additional operational overhead compared to a single global stack.
- **EU UI with US backend & storage**: Kept the backend and database on the US side to avoid duplicating and synchronizing a full database in the EU, reducing cost and operational complexity
- **GDPR compliance first**: Prioritized data privacy and regulatory compliance from day one
- **Distributed team coordination**: Managed remote teams across multiple European sites
- **Certification integration**: Invested in training system integration to ensure safety and compliance
- **Phased rollout**: Deployed incrementally to validate performance and gather feedback
- **Local customization**: Balanced standardization with country-specific labor requirements

## Architecture


- **Web frontend (EU)**: Provides a dedicated European UI with region-specific shift configuration, templates, and access control while reusing shared platform components

- **API layer**: Exposes domain-specific APIs for configuration, planning, roster generation, and publishing via API Gateway to separate concerns and scale independently

- **Data ingestion pipelines**: Ingests employee schedules, availability, and certification data from EU systems, with controlled manual uploads during early rollout phases

- **Storage layer**: Stores large shift plans and generated rosters in S3, while using DynamoDB for configuration data and frequently updated planning data

- **Workflow orchestration**: Coordinates roster generation and publishing through event-driven Lambda workflows to ensure reliability and traceability

- **Downstream integration**: Publishes generated rosters automatically to FastStart via S3, enabling a controlled transition from legacy upload Tools

- **Security and access control**: Enforces role-based authorization aligned with EU privacy and data-access requirements

## Outcomes / Metrics

- 4.8 minutes saved per associate per day
- Incident reduction of 5-17% across sites
- $4.1 million in total benefits delivered
- Improved efficiency and safety at scale
- Successful GDPR compliance across all European sites
- High user adoption and satisfaction

## What I'd Improve

- Add predictive task assignment based on historical performance
- Enhance mobile experience for on-the-floor task management
- Integrate real-time workload balancing across sites
- Develop more sophisticated skills gap analysis
- Expand automation to include break scheduling and rotation
