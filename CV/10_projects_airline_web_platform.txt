## Summary

Led the design and delivery of an Instant Search web platform for airlines and online travel agencies, enabling the display of hundreds of travel offers in real time for promotional campaigns, long-term calendars, and email alerts. The platform relied on a massive pre-computation approach to deliver instant responses at scale, improving user experience, early-funnel conversion, and operational efficiency.

## Problem

Traditional airline search systems depended on real-time queries to multiple providers, resulting in slow response times, inconsistent pricing, and poor user experience. These limitations reduced customer inspiration, increased booking abandonment, and generated higher volumes of customer support requests.

## Context

The project targeted global airlines and travel platforms serving millions of users. The solution needed to support high traffic volumes, return search results instantly, and power marketing-driven use cases such as promotions, multi-month calendars, and personalized alerts, while managing controlled trade-offs on real-time availability.

## My Role

I acted as Product Manager for the Instant Search platform:

- Led end-to-end product discovery, requirements gathering, and roadmap definition  
- Conducted usage and benchmark analysis to identify high-impact business use cases  
- Facilitated client workshops to define user journeys, interactions, and KPIs  
- Authored and validated the Statement of Requirements (SOR) with all stakeholders  
- Managed technical trade-offs and aligned expectations between business and engineering  
- Owned backlog prioritization, sprint planning, and functional validation  
- Acted as primary client point of contact during launch and early production phases  

## Decisions & Trade-offs

- **Pre-computation over real-time queries**: Enabled instant search results at the cost of potential availability drift  
- **Inspiration-first UX**: Optimized for discovery and marketing use cases rather than strict transactional accuracy  
- **Performance vs freshness**: Accepted controlled price consistency targets instead of real-time guarantees  
- **Scalability**: Designed the platform to absorb traffic peaks driven by promotions  
- **Flexibility**: Supported multiple use cases without duplicating platforms  

## Architecture

The platform was built on a Massive Computation Platform :

- Daily pre-calculation of travel offers across routes and dates  
- Storage of computed offers in a high-performance data store  
- Instant search APIs serving web and mobile frontends  
- Integration with airline booking systems for downstream reservation flows  
- Configurable UI components for promotions, long-range calendars, and alerts  
- Monitoring of response time, availability consistency, and system uptime  

## Outcomes / Metrics

- Instant search feature delivered at scale for millions of users  
- Widely adopted by airlines for promotional and discovery use cases  
- Sub-second response times in early booking funnel stages  
- Improved conversion through faster and more intuitive search experiences  
- Reduced load on real-time airline pricing systems  
- Positive customer feedback and long-term product adoption  

## What I'd Improve


- Improve availability refresh strategies to reduce price drift  
- Add predictive demand and pricing insights  
- Strengthen experimentation and A/B testing frameworks  
- Extend analytics on inspiration-to-booking conversion
- Integrate social proof and user reviews
