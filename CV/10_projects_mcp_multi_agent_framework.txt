## Summary

Prototyped a multi-agent AI system using Amazon Q and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to automate cross-platform workflows and reduce manual operational effort. The framework enables AI agents to coordinate tasks across different systems, improving efficiency and reducing human intervention in repetitive processes.

## Problem

Operational teams faced significant manual effort coordinating tasks across multiple platforms and systems. Workflows required context switching, manual data transfer, and repetitive decision-making, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and delayed execution.

## Context

The project was developed to explore how multi-agent AI systems could orchestrate complex workflows spanning multiple tools and platforms. The goal was to reduce operational overhead while maintaining control, auditability, and reliability in production environments.

## My Role

I acted as Product Lead for the MCP framework prototype:

- Identified high-impact use cases for multi-agent automation
- Defined the architecture and interaction patterns between agents
- Designed the coordination logic and handoff protocols
- Partnered with engineering teams to implement the MCP-based solution
- Evaluated performance and identified opportunities for production deployment

## Decisions & Trade-offs

- **MCP over custom protocols**: Chose Model Context Protocol for standardization and interoperability
- **Amazon Q integration**: Leveraged existing AI infrastructure to accelerate development
- **Controlled autonomy**: Designed agents with explicit boundaries and human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- **Prototype-first approach**: Focused on proving value before full production investment
- **Cross-platform coordination**: Accepted complexity to enable true end-to-end automation

## Architecture

The MCP framework enables multiple AI agents to coordinate across platforms:

- **Agent orchestration**: Central coordinator manages task distribution and agent communication
- **MCP protocol**: Standardized context sharing and handoff between agents
- **Amazon Q integration**: Leverages Amazon Q for natural language understanding and task execution
- **Platform connectors**: Agents interface with multiple systems (databases, APIs, internal tools)
- **Audit trail**: All agent actions and decisions are logged for traceability
- **Human oversight**: Critical decisions escalate to human operators

## Outcomes / Metrics

- Successfully demonstrated cross-platform workflow automation
- Reduced manual operational effort in pilot use cases
- Validated MCP as a viable protocol for multi-agent coordination
- Identified production deployment opportunities and requirements

## What I'd Improve

- Expand agent capabilities to cover more workflow types
- Implement more sophisticated error handling and recovery
- Add predictive task routing based on historical patterns
- Develop better visualization of agent coordination and decision-making
- Strengthen security and access control for cross-platform operations
