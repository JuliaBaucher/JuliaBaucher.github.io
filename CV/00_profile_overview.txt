## Professional Overview

Senior Product Leader with 15+ years of experience turning complex digital technologies into production-ready solutions that integrate seamlessly into real business and operational workflows. I lead products end to end, from identifying high-impact use cases and defining strategy to designing architectures and driving execution.

With a background in leading multiple pre-sales engagements and consulting missions, I build long-lasting relationships with C-level stakeholders and translate executive vision into on-the-ground execution. Certified in Agile and SAFe, I run training sessions for large technical and non-technical audiences and support teams in adopting scalable delivery practices.

I constantly thrive on building products that scale, teams that align, and solutions that deliver measurable impact. My work includes AI-powered assistants, MCP frameworks, ML forecasting models, web platforms, and BI solutions.
