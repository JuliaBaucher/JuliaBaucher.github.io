## Summary

Led end-to-end development of a machine learning model that forecasts employee absences, improving forecast accuracy by 400 basis points. The model enables better capacity planning, staffing decisions, and operational efficiency in high-throughput environments.

## Problem

Operations teams struggled with inaccurate absence forecasts, leading to overstaffing (increased costs) or understaffing (reduced throughput and service quality). Existing forecasting methods were manual, inconsistent, and failed to capture complex patterns in absence behavior.

## Context

The project was developed for operational environments where workforce availability directly impacts business performance. Accurate absence forecasting is critical for capacity planning, shift scheduling, and maintaining service level agreements.

## My Role

I acted as Product Owner for the ML forecasting solution:

- Defined the end-to-end product strategy, including the business problem, roadmap, success criteria, and key risks  
- Aligned the definition of employee absence across stakeholders to ensure consistent data and decision-making  
- Identified, assessed, and prepared relevant data sources in collaboration with data and engineering teams  
- Led model development with data scientists, from design through validation and performance evaluation  
- Defined accuracy targets and success metrics, and oversaw model testing and comparison with existing baselines  
- Managed integration with workforce planning systems and supported production rollout and adoption  
- Established monitoring and continuous improvement processes post-deployment  
- Contributed to the expansion strategy to scale the model to additional sites and business lines  




## Decisions & Trade-offs

- **Probabilistic vs deterministic ML**: Selected a probabilistic model to capture uncertainty and variability in absence patterns, using the median forecast as a stable point estimate for planning, accepting increased training and operational complexity.
- **Weekly retraining over real-time learning**: Chosen weekly retraining to prioritize forecast stability, governance, and alignment with workforce planning cycles, accepting slower reactions to sudden changes.

- **Accuracy over interpretability**: Prioritized forecast accuracy while maintaining sufficient explainability for operations teams
- **Historical data focus**: Leveraged extensive historical absence data to train robust models
- **Incremental rollout**: Deployed gradually to validate performance before full adoption
- **Continuous retraining**: Implemented MLOps pipeline for regular model updates

## Architecture

- **Data pipeline**: Defined weekly pipelines ingesting historical attendance data, shift schedules, known absences (holidays, planned leave), and contextual signals such as day-of-week, seasonality, bank holidays, and major operational events.

- **ML model**: Selected a probabilistic deep learning time-series model (DeepAR, an autoregressive recurrent neural network implemented in GluonTS) to learn temporal dependencies, seasonality, and event-driven patterns across thousands of related time series.

- **Output format**: Produced a probability distribution (Student-t) for unknown absence rates, generated multiple forecast samples per site, shift, and employee category, and used the median as a stable point estimate for operational planning.

- **Feature engineering**: Extracted temporal patterns, seasonality effects, and employee-specific trends to improve forecast accuracy and robustness.

- **Training & evaluation**: Retrained the model weekly, evaluated performance using WAPE and MAE, and validated results across multiple runs to ensure robustness and consistency before deployment.

- **Integration layer**: Integrated forecasts into the workforce management platform to enable timely and automated delivery of predictions to operations teams.

- **Monitoring**: Tracked model outputs and performance metrics through a BI dashboard, enabling operations and planning teams to monitor forecast quality and adoption over time.


## Outcomes / Metrics

- Improved forecast accuracy by 400 basis points
- Enabled more accurate capacity planning and staffing decisions
- Reduced operational costs through better resource allocation
- Reduced workforce planning time through automated absence predictions and seamless platform integration
- Provided foundation for additional ML-driven workforce optimization

## What I'd Improve

- Incorporate additional external signals (e.g., weather, employee feedback) to improve absence predictions
- Increase explainability by exposing the factors influencing each prediction to support adoption
- Communicate confidence intervals to users to convey forecast uncertainty and support better risk evaluation
- Expand the model to other business lines
