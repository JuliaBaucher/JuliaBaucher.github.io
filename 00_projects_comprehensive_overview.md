## List of All Julia's Projects

### Complete Project Portfolio Overview
Julia's project portfolio includes machine learning models, AI assistants, web platforms, data analytics dashboards, and strategic consulting initiatives. Below are all of Julia's projects described in detail.

## Machine Learning & AI Projects

### 1. ML Model for Employee Absence Forecasting
Led end-to-end development of a machine learning model that forecasts employee absences, improving forecast accuracy by 400 basis points. The model enables better capacity planning, staffing decisions, and operational efficiency in high-throughput environments. Used probabilistic deep learning time-series models (DeepAR) with weekly retraining cycles. Reduced workforce planning time through automated predictions and seamless platform integration.

### 2. AI Assistant for ML Forecast Explainability (AskMe)
AskMe is a GenAI-powered chatbot built on AWS Bedrock that interprets ML forecast outputs for operational and planning teams. It provides role-based, explainable answers grounded in trusted data sources, reducing reliance on expert teams and accelerating decision-making from days to minutes. Features S3-based knowledge storage, RAG pipeline with semantic retrieval, and role-aware responses for different personas.

### 3. MCP Multi-Agent Automation Framework
Prototyped a multi-agent AI system using Amazon Q and MCP, accessible via a command-line interface. The framework enables AI agents to coordinate actions across multiple systems, reducing manual tasks and improving efficiency in repetitive operational workflows. Features agent orchestration, standardized context sharing, and human oversight for critical decisions.

## Web Development & Platform Projects

### 4. Airline Web Platform (Instant Search)
Led the design and delivery of an Instant Search web platform for airlines, enabling the display of hundreds of travel offers for promotional campaigns, long-term calendars, and email alerts. The platform improves user experience, early-funnel conversion, and operational efficiency. Achieved instant search response times (~1 second), reached ≥80% price consistency, and increased airline website traffic by ~10% with ~5% booking conversion improvement.

### 5. SARG Workforce Task Allocation Platform
Led the European adaptation and deployment of a web application that automates task and role assignment for warehouse associates based on schedules, staffing needs, and training certifications, improving operational performance, safety, and compliance across sites. Delivered 4.8 minutes saved per associate per day, incident reduction of 5-17% across sites, and $4.1 million in total benefits with full GDPR compliance.

## Data Analytics & Business Intelligence Projects

### 6. Workforce Management Dashboard
Delivered a real-time workforce management dashboard that replaced manual productivity metrics with event-driven, scan-based measurements, enabling more accurate performance tracking, faster operational decisions, and improved labor allocation for on-the-ground operations teams. Achieved 3× more accurate productivity rates, enabled 6% labor automation, and delivered €6.54 entitlement through improved labor allocation.

## Consulting & Strategic Projects

### 7. Revenue Accounting & Auditing Platform
Managed product strategy, consulting, and pre-sales for enterprise revenue accounting and auditing software for global airline clients, aiming to optimize revenue recognition, reduce manual effort, improve financial accuracy, and strengthen reporting and audit readiness. Delivered significant reduction in manual workload, improved revenue accuracy, faster financial close, and measurable customer savings (e.g., ~€1.5M saved for a major airline).

### 8. Strategic Partnership Framework (ACES & APP Tech)
Led a strategic partnership between operational projects, support teams, and technology partners. Established governance structures, investment strategies, and continuous feedback mechanisms to align stakeholders, optimize resource allocation, and ensure successful project delivery. Achieved investment decisions arbitrated and roadmaps validated by all stakeholders, programs coordinated across teams, and improved delivery speed through clearer governance.
